## Description

This website is for the client 'Horiseon" and I was tasked to ensure accessibility as well as a clean code base.

## Installation

## Usage

The webite now ensures accessibility features liek alternate text and also enables screen readers to understand the navigation bar section. Additonally, the code base for HTML and CSS are both cleaned-up ensuring that duplicate style elements are consolidated, semantic sections to the HTML file are descriptive, and that the style file is in the correct order.
